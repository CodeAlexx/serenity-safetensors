# tensor_view.mojo — TensorView: a tensor's typed metadata bundled with an
# ORIGIN-BOUND view of its raw bytes.
#
# Chunk 2 of the serenity-safetensors -> Mojo port (BUILD_PLAN.md row
# "tensor_view.mojo"). Builds on chunk-1 `SafeTensors` (safetensors.mojo) and
# its origin-bound `tensor_bytes(self,name) -> Span[UInt8, origin_of(self)]`.
#
# The whole point of this type is the LIFETIME CONTRACT inherited from chunk-1's
# F1 fix: the bytes are a `Span[UInt8, origin]` where `origin` is a STRUCT
# PARAMETER tied to the source `SafeTensors`. The compiler therefore keeps the
# source (and its mmap'd region) alive for exactly as long as any TensorView
# over it is in use. No bare/untracked pointer is ever stored.
#
# Scope of the compile-time guarantee (chunk-2 skeptic F2 — accurate claim):
# the origin binding compile-rejects escape-returning a view past its source and
# using a view past an explicit `src^.__del__()`. It does NOT catch
# *reassigning/overwriting* the source binding while a view is live
# (`var v = ...; src = other` compiles and yields a use-after-free) — a Mojo
# 1.0.0b1 origin-tracking limitation. Not reassigning the source while a view is
# live is the caller's contract.
#
# Mojo 1.0.0b1, Linux x86-64.

struct TensorView[mut: Bool, //, origin: Origin[mut=mut]](Movable):
    """A tensor's typed metadata + an origin-bound view of its raw bytes.

    Parametric on `origin`: the byte view (`data`) carries `Self.origin`, which
    is tied to the source `SafeTensors`. Because the origin is part of the type,
    escape-returning a `TensorView` past its source, or using one past an
    explicit `src^.__del__()`, is a compile error — the same use-after-munmap
    protection chunk-1 established for `tensor_bytes`, now carried in a value you
    can pass around and store *within the source's scope*. Reassigning the
    source binding while a view is live is NOT caught (see module header F2);
    avoiding that is the caller's contract.

    Fields:
      * `dtype` — the safetensors dtype (STDtype; carries label + byte size).
      * `shape` — the tensor's dimensions (row-major, as stored).
      * `data`  — `Span[UInt8, Self.origin]` over the exact tensor bytes in the
                  mmap'd data segment (length == nbytes)."""

# NOTE on the public builder shape (chunk-2 finding):
#
# A one-call `view_of(st, name) -> TensorView[origin_of(st)]` does NOT compile
# in Mojo 1.0.0b1: naming the return origin `origin_of(st)` makes a symbol that
# the compiler refuses to unify with the *inferred* origin of the span returned
# by `st.tensor_bytes(name)` (both print as `origin_of(st)` — a real Mojo
# origin-identity quirk, reproduced in parity/probe_view_origin.mojo). The
# clean, working idiom infers the origin FROM the span at the call site:
#
#     var info  = st.tensor_info(name)
#     var bytes = st.tensor_bytes(name)        # Span[UInt8, <st's origin>]
#     var view  = from_parts(info.dtype, info.shape.copy(), bytes)
#
# `from_parts` infers `origin` from `bytes`, so the TensorView is correctly
# lifetime-bound to `st` with no named-origin mismatch and no unsafe cast.
# `ShardedSafeTensors.tensor_view` uses exactly this idiom over its owned shard.
