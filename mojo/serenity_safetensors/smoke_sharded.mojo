# smoke_sharded.mojo — opens the Z-Image *transformer* directory (2 shards +
# index) via ShardedSafeTensors and prints total tensor count + 3 sample
# tensors, including at least one resident in shard 00002 (proves cross-shard
# resolution through the weight_map).
#
# Run: pixi run mojo run -I . serenitymojo/io/smoke_sharded.mojo
#
# Snapshot dir resolved 2026-05-25 via:
#   ls ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Tongyi-MAI--Z-Image/snapshots/*/transformer/
# (one snapshot) -> hardcoded below. Expect 521 tensors (weight_map size):
# 423 in shard 00001, 98 in shard 00002.
