# ffi.mojo — libc externs for the safetensors read path. Linux x86-64 only.
#
# Mirrors the libc calls serenity-safetensors src/mmap.rs makes:
#   libc::mmap, libc::munmap, libc::madvise, libc::sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE),
#   plus open/close/pread/lseek for reading the 8-byte length + header bytes.
#
# All constants are HARDCODED for Linux x86-64 (asm-generic / x86_64 ABI):
#   PROT_READ      = 0x1
#   MAP_PRIVATE    = 0x2
#   MAP_NORESERVE  = 0x4000
#   MADV_WILLNEED  = 3
#   MADV_DONTNEED  = 4
#   _SC_PAGESIZE   = 30        (glibc sysconf name)
#   O_RDONLY       = 0
#   SEEK_END       = 2         (lseek whence, used by file_size)
#   SEEK_SET       = 0
#   MAP_FAILED     = (void*)-1 (mmap error sentinel)
#
# external_call idiom (Mojo 1.0.0b1): external_call["c_name", RetType](args...).
# Pointer width: Mojo Int is 64-bit on this target; size_t/off_t args are passed
# as Int. fd / 32-bit-int args are passed as Int32 to match the C ABI exactly.

    A single 3-arg `external_call["open"]` signature is used everywhere so the
    symbol has ONE declaration (a 2-arg + 3-arg mix conflicts at lowering, the
    same class of collision that the stdlib builtin `open` would cause — which
    is why all file I/O in this lib routes through here, never `open()`).

    Mojo's `String.unsafe_ptr()` does NOT reliably point at a NUL-terminated C
    string for dynamically-built Strings (e.g. those produced by path joining /
    concatenation): once an mmap from such a path is held alive the heap layout
    shifts and libc `open()` reads past the bytes -> spurious -1/ENOENT for a
    path that exists (chunk-2 skeptic F1, proven in parity/probe_nulfix.mojo).
